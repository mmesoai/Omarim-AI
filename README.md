# Omarim AI: Autonomous Business Development Platform

Welcome to Omarim AI, a next-generation autonomous business development partner designed to help you grow your business with the power of artificial intelligence. This platform automates critical tasks, from lead generation and e-commerce sourcing to content creation and social media management.

This project was built collaboratively in Firebase Studio. It is a fully functional prototype with a complete user interface and a powerful AI engine powered by Google's Gemini models through Genkit.

## Next Steps: From Prototype to Production

The application is feature-complete and ready for its final activation. To transition from this prototype to a live, production-ready system, you will need to connect it to real-world services by providing the necessary API keys.

I have prepared a detailed guide that walks you through this final process.
