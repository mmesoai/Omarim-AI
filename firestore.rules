/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  All data is nested under /users/{userId},
 * and users can only read and write data they own. The rule prioritizes simplicity and security.
 * Data shape validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, including leads, products, outreach sequences,
 * emails, and stores. This ensures clear ownership and prevents unauthorized access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Default security posture is strict owner-only access unless otherwise specified.
 * - Denormalization is used to avoid costly `get()` calls within rules, improving performance
 *   and preventing potential rule execution failures.
